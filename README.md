# react-use-numeric-entry

Numeric Entry Control is the React hook that allows to use some keys for adding zeros at the end of number.

For example, when user type 5 and presses K, result in input will be 5000.

When user presses K the system should add 000 to existing number.

When user presses H the system should add 00 to existing number.

When user presses M the system should add 000000 to existing number.

When user presses B the system should add 000000000 to existing number.

When user presses T the system should add 000000000000 to existing number.


User can press H/K/M keys multiple times.

Also works with decimals numbers.

## Note
* Works only if cursor at the end of input field
* Doesn't work with exponential numbers
